# The Fullman Firm: 5-Minute Meeting Cheat Sheet

## 🎯 The Core Problem
**90% of spend on Google Ads + Declining Revenue = Policy Throttling**

Google is likely categorizing landing pages as "Restricted Debt Services" even though you're a law firm. This creates an "invisible wall" that reduces impressions and increases costs.

---

## 💡 The "Entity Defense" Golden Ticket

**Fact:** In California, LLCs and Corporations **cannot represent themselves** in court. They must have an attorney.

**Opportunity:**
- High margins (businesses pay more)
- Low competition (fewer firms target this)
- Less policy risk (clearly legal representation)
- Recurring clients

**Action:** Allocate **40%+ of ad spend** to business debt keywords immediately.

## 🚨 The Google Policy "Invisible Wall"

**What's Happening:**
- Your landing pages say "Debt Relief" → Google flags as restricted
- Even if ads aren't disapproved, impressions get throttled
- Quality scores drop → costs increase → revenue declines

**The Fix (48 Hours):**
1. Strip "Debt Relief" from all H1s
2. Replace with "Lawsuit Defense" / "Legal Representation"
3. Change CTAs from "Settle My Debt" to "Stop Wage Garnishment"

**Keywords to AVOID:**
- ❌ "Debt Settlement"
- ❌ "Debt Relief"
- ❌ "Settle My Debt"
- ❌ "Reduce Debt"

**Keywords to USE:**
- ✅ "Summons Defense"
- ✅ "Wage Garnishment Defense"
- ✅ "Lawsuit Defense Attorney"
- ✅ "Business Debt Lawsuit"

---

## 💰 The Fee Structure: Trust Signal vs. Risk

**Current Model:** Flat Fee + 5% Savings Bonus

**The Problem:**
- "Savings Bonus" sounds like debt settlement to Google's bots
- May trigger policy scanners even though it's legal

**The Solution:**
- Reframe as "Performance-Based Legal Fees"
- Or "Results-Based Attorney Compensation"
- Emphasize: "We succeed when your case is dismissed"

---

## 🎯 The "A-Team" Strategy

**Your Differentiator:**
- Most debt settlement: Aim for 50% reduction
- Fullman Firm: Aim for **$0** (complete dismissal)

**Ad Messaging:**
- "The Creditors Made a Mistake - We Find It"
- "Get Your Case Dismissed, Not Settled"
- "Why Pay 50% When You Can Pay $0?"

**Landing Page Focus:**
- Emphasize **dismissal rate**, not settlement amounts
- Showcase cases where debt was completely eliminated
- Highlight procedural error expertise

---

## 📊 Campaign Restructure (Immediate)

**Current:** $1,500/day on consumer debt (likely throttled)

**Recommended Split:**
- **40%** ($600/day): **Business Debt Lawsuits** ← START HERE
- **30%** ($450/day): Summons Defense
- **20%** ($300/day): Wage Garnishment
- **10%** ($150/day): Judgment Defense

## 💬 Key Talking Points

**When Asked: "Why is revenue declining?"**
→ "Google's policy algorithms are throttling impressions because our messaging is too close to 'Debt Settlement' (restricted) rather than 'Legal Defense' (allowed). We need to pivot our language immediately."

**When Asked: "What's the biggest opportunity?"**
→ "Business debt lawsuits. California requires LLCs/Corporations to have attorney representation. It's high-margin, low-competition, and less policy risk. We should allocate 40%+ of spend there."

**When Asked: "What's the biggest risk?"**
→ "90% dependency on Google Ads. If that account gets suspended, the firm potentially dies in 30 days. We need immediate de-risking and channel diversification."

**When Asked: "What makes you different?"**
→ "We aim for $0 dismissals by finding procedural errors, not 50% settlements. That's our 'A-Team' strategy - 'The Creditors Made a Mistake, We Find It.'"
