# Landing Page Comparison: Old vs. New

## 🔴 CRITICAL POLICY VIOLATIONS FIXED

### URL Structure
- **OLD:** `/consumer-relief/` ❌ (Red flag - "relief" is restricted)
- **NEW:** `/lawsuit-defense/` or `/legal-defense/` ✅ (Policy-compliant)

### Hero Section H1
- **OLD:** "Being Sued by Creditors? We Can Help" (Too generic)
- **NEW:** "Stop Creditor Lawsuits Before They Damage Your Credit" ✅ (Action-oriented, legal defense focus)

### Success Stories Language
- **OLD:** "A balance of $67,762 was **settled for** a total of $5,160" ❌
- **NEW:** "$18,185 Total Debt Defended - **CASE DISMISSED** - Client owed $0" ✅

**Key Change:** Focus on **dismissals** and **$0 outcomes**, not settlement amounts.

### Primary CTA
- **OLD:** "I Need Help Settling My Debt" (In menu) ❌
- **NEW:** "Get Legal Defense Now" / "Stop Wage Garnishment" ✅

### Service Description
- **OLD:** "We will help you explore all your options so that you can make the best decisions about whether to **settle or fight** the lawsuit in court."
- **NEW:** "We help you explore all your legal options so you can make the best decisions about **defending your case**. Our goal is to get cases **dismissed** by finding procedural errors."

**Key Change:** Remove "settle" language, emphasize "defend" and "dismiss."
